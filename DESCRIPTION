Description:
    Functions to compute Euclidean Minimum Spanning Trees using single-,
    sesqui-, and dual-tree Boruvka algorithms.  Thanks to K-d trees, they are
    fast in spaces of low intrinsic dimensionality.  Mutual reachability
    distances (used in the definition of the 'HDBSCAN*' algorithm)
    are also supported.  The package also features relatively fast fallback
    minimum spanning tree and nearest-neighbours algorithms for spaces of
    higher dimensionality.  The 'Python' version of 'quitefastmst' is available
    via 'PyPI'.
