The minimum spanning tree (MST) of a set of *n* points is an acyclic undirected
connected graph whose:

* vertices represent the points,
* edges are weighted by the distances between point pairs,
* edges have minimal total weight.

MSTs have many uses in, amongst others, topological data analysis
(clustering, density estimation, dimensionality reduction,
outlier detection, etc.).


The `mst_euclid` function can determine the classic
Euclidean minimum spanning trees (EMST) as well as ones
corresponding to mutual reachability distances {cite}`hdbscan`.
