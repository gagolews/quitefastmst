::::{note}
This section is a work in progress.
Below we present some preliminary results.

## Platform

All timings were performed on a mid-tier laptop with an
Intel Core i7-1355U (AVX2-VNNI) (12 threads, 2 performance cores, 8 efficient cores) CPU with 12MB cache
and 32 GB RAM, running GNU/Linux 6.15.5-1-default #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC (478c062) x86_64 openSUSE Tumbleweed.

Python 3.13.5 [gcc] OpenBLAS 0.3.29;
packages:
**quitefastmst** 0.9.0,
**numba** 0.61.2,
**cython** 3.1.2,
**numpy** 2.2.6,
**scipy** 1.15.3,
**sklearn** 1.7.0,
**[hdbscan](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/hdbscan)** {cite}`hdbscanpkg` 0.8.40,
**[fast_hdbscan](https://github.com/TutteInstitute/fast_hdbscan/)**+ {cite}`fasthdbscan` 0.2.2 (compiled via numba),
**rpy2** 3.6.1.

R version 4.5.1 (2025-06-13) Rblas;
R packages (via **rpy2**):
**[mlpack](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack)**+ {cite}`mlpack` 4.6.2.

Other:
**[wangyiqiu_hdbscan](https://github.com/wangyiqiu/hdbscan)**+ e120dcf.

*+* means that a package was compiled with `-O3 -march=native`
using gcc 15.1.1 20250626



## Experiment Setup

For different $n$ and $d$, $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ were generated,
with each coordinate sampled independently from the standard normal distribution.
This is a pretty "difficult" setting for the spatial search data structures
as data are very "unstructured".  Most real-world datasets are more well-behaving.

We tested smoothing parameters $M=1$ (standard Euclidean MSTs) and $M=10$.

Number of threads was set to 1 or 10.  Note that **mlpack** does not support
parallel processing and only implements standard EMSTs.
**[wangyiqiu_hdbscan](https://github.com/wangyiqiu/hdbscan)**
required some trickery to be run from the terminal â€“ it does not work out
of the box.

For each $n$, $d$, and $M$, three runs were performed and the smallest
timing was recorded.  Moreover, there was a pre-run on a subset of the
input dataset to ensure **fast_hdbscan** got compiled on-the-fly by **numba**.
**hdbscan_kdtree** was not run for larger $n$s.

See the relevant Python scripts:
[`perf_mst_202506.py`](https://github.com/gagolews/quitefastmst/blob/0b29075589475223f4eb43a16204b82df3a82cde/.devel/benchmarks/perf_mst_202506.py),
[`perf_mst_202506_defs`.py](https://github.com/gagolews/quitefastmst/blob/0b29075589475223f4eb43a16204b82df3a82cde/.devel/benchmarks/perf_mst_202506_defs.py)



## Results

All timings are given in seconds.
Less is better.
